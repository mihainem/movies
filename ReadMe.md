# Movie CRUD Application

This repository contains a full-stack web application for managing movies. It includes a Flask API server with CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, a front-end interface for interacting with the API, and integration with Procesio for executing database operations.

## Features

- **API Server**: Built with Flask, provides endpoints for managing movie entities.
- **Front-End Interface**: Allows users to add, edit, and delete movies.
- **Procesio Integration**: Uses Procesio to handle CRUD operations directly on the database.

## Installation

To get this project up and running on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mihainem/movies

   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   Ensure that you have Python and Node.js installed on your system, then run:
   ```bash
   # Install Python dependencies
   pip install -r requirements.txt

   # If there is a front-end part using Node.js
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```

3. **Environment Variables**
   Set up the necessary environment variables, including the Procesio API keys and database credentials:
   ```bash
   export WEBHOOK='your_webhook_url'
   # Other necessary environment variables
   ```

4. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   # Run the Flask app
   python app.py

   # Run the frontend in development mode, if separate
   npm start

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can access the API at `http://localhost:5000/` and the front-end interface at the specified port. Use the web interface to add, edit, or delete movie entries.
